# Assignment

Develop a program in the JavaScript programming language based on your solution to homework 1 that will convert a number from one number system to another. You can choose between which number systems you will convert numbers. The program will contain at least one function with an input argument that will contain the number to be converted. The return value of this function will contain the converted number in the required number system.

Create the program in a separate JavaScript file that is either executable within NodeJS or attached to the HTML page within which the program is interpreted.

The algorithm you design must convert a number between different number systems.

An example can be converting a number from binary to decimal.
